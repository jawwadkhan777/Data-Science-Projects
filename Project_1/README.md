# Python Challenges Collection

This repository contains three engaging Python challenges: **Compatibility Testing**, **Virtual Coin Toss**, and the **Treasure Island Game**. These projects are developed on **Google Colab** as part of my learning journey in Python programming and the Data Science course.

Each challenge demonstrates key programming concepts, and interactive gameplay, and provides a fun way to practice problem-solving in Python.

## Challenges Overview

### 1. Compatibility Testing
This Python challenge calculates the compatibility between two people based on their names. Inspired by a fun and entertaining way to test friendship or relationship compatibility, it uses a basic algorithm to output a percentage score. 

Key Concepts:
- String manipulation
- Conditional statements
- Input/output handling

### 2. Virtual Coin Toss
A simple yet captivating Python project that simulates the tossing of a coin. It randomly outputs "Heads" or "Tails," making use of Python's random module.

Key Concepts:
- Random module usage
- Simulating probability
- Basic input/output functions

### 3. Treasure Island Game
A text-based adventure game where the player has to make choices to find the hidden treasure. The player navigates through different scenarios based on their decisions. Will you find the treasure or fall into traps?

Key Concepts:
- Conditional logic
- Input/output handling
- Interactive gameplay
- Loops and decision trees
