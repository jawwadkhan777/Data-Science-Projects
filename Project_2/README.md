# Hangman Game üïπÔ∏è

Welcome to the **Hangman Game**, a console-based word-guessing game implemented using Python in **Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook**. This project is part of my learning journey in Python programming and Data Science Course.

## About the Game üéÆ

**Hangman** is a classic word-guessing game where the computer picks a word, and the player tries to guess it letter by letter. Here's how it works:

- The computer selects a word and presents it as a series of underscores (`_`), each representing a letter in the word.
- The player (you) attempts to guess the word by suggesting letters one at a time.
- If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed in its correct position.
- If the guessed letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman (a stick figure) is drawn.
- The game continues until:
  - The word is guessed correctly, or
  - The hangman is fully drawn, and the game is lost.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Interactive Gameplay**: The game provides real-time feedback on each guessed letter.
- **Word Randomization**: The computer selects a random word each time you play, ensuring that no two games are alike.
- **Stick Figure Drawing**: A part of the hangman is drawn each time a wrong letter is guessed.
- **Winning & Losing**: The game ends when either the word is guessed, or the hangman is fully drawn.
