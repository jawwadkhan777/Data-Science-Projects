# US States Game

This repository contains a **US States Game** developed using **Python** with the libraries **pandas** and **turtle**. This project is part of my **Data Science Course** and is an interactive game that helps users learn and guess the states of the United States.

## Project Overview üéØ

The **US States Game** is an interactive quiz where the user guesses the names of US states. The game features:
- A **blank map** of the United States where correctly guessed states are displayed.
- An **input window** where the user enters their guesses for US state names.
- The game continues until the user types **‚Äúexit‚Äù** in the input window, which terminates the game.

This game provides a fun way to test and improve your knowledge of US geography.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Interactive Map**: A blank map of the US is displayed, and as you guess the states, their names appear on the map.
- **State Guessing Input**: The user inputs guesses for US state names in a pop-up window.
- **Completion Tracking**: The game continues until all states are guessed, or the user exits using the "exit" keyword.
- **Data Science Application**: The game leverages the `pandas` library for data management and the `turtle` library for GUI rendering.

## How to Play üéÆ

1. Run the script, and two pop-up windows will appear:
   - **Window 1**: A blank map of the United States.
   - **Window 2**: An input box to guess US states.
   
2. Start typing the names of US states in the input window.

3. When a correct state name is guessed, it will appear on the blank map in its respective location.

4. If you wish to end the game, type **‚Äúexit‚Äù** in the input window, and the game will close.

5. The game tracks the states you have guessed and provides a fun learning experience!
